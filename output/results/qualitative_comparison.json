    "What is the mechanism of action of metformin?": "Metformin is an oral antidiabetes medication that works by reducing insulin resistance, improving glucose uptake into cells, and inhibiting the production of glucose by the liver. Metformin acts by binding to and activating the insulin receptor, which leads to decreased insulin secretion and improved glucose uptake into cells. This results in increased glucose disposal through the liver and reduced glucose production by the liver and muscle tissue.",
    "What are the classic symptoms of appendicitis?": "The classic symptoms of appendicitis include pain in the right upper quadrant or back, particularly when coughing, sneezing, or lifting heavy objects. Nausea or vomiting. Abdominal pain that may be sharp or dull, with or without fever, nausea, or vomiting. A feeling of fullness or distension in the abdomen.",
    "How does the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system work?": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a hormone system that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance. Renin is released by the kidneys in response to low blood pressure or low sodium levels. Renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction and stimulates aldosterone release, which increases sodium and water retention.",
    "What is the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes?": "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. Type 1 requires insulin therapy while Type 2 is initially managed with lifestyle changes and oral medications.",
    "What are the side effects of beta-blockers?": "Beta-blockers can cause bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue, cold extremities, bronchospasm (particularly non-selective agents), and may mask hypoglycaemia symptoms in diabetics. Other side effects include sleep disturbance, erectile dysfunction, and depression."

    "What is the mechanism of action of metformin?": "Metformin works by inhibiting gluconeogenesis, which is the process by which glucose is produced from non-carbohydrate sources such as glycogen or fatty acids. By blocking this process, metformin can help to reduce blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity. Metformin also activates AMPK, which reduces hepatic glucose output and improves peripheral glucose uptake.",
    "What are the classic symptoms of appendicitis?": "Classic appendicitis presents with periumbilical pain migrating to the right iliac fossa (McBurney's point), nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever. Rebound tenderness and guarding are common signs. The Rovsing sign (pain in the right iliac fossa upon palpation of the left) may also be present.",
    "How does the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system work?": "The RAAS regulates blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. Low renal perfusion pressure stimulates juxtaglomerular cells to release renin, which cleaves angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. ACE in the pulmonary vasculature converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that also stimulates aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex, leading to sodium and water retention and increased blood pressure.",
    "What is the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes?": "Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, causing absolute insulin deficiency and requiring lifelong insulin therapy. Type 2 diabetes involves progressive insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, typically managed initially with metformin and lifestyle modification. Type 1 usually presents in childhood or adolescence while Type 2 is more common in adults with obesity and sedentary lifestyle.",
    "What are the side effects of beta-blockers?": "Common side effects of beta-blockers include bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue, cold extremities, and bronchospasm (especially with non-selective agents such as propranolol). They can mask hypoglycaemia in diabetic patients, cause erectile dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and vivid dreams. Abrupt withdrawal can precipitate rebound hypertension and angina."
